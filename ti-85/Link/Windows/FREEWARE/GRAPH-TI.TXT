ABOUT GRAPH-TI.TXT 
------------------ 
  
This file contains information about the Texas Instruments World Wide 
Web pages and the graphing calculator e-mail interest groups.  It 
explains how to access the TI archives, and join and use the network to 
can exchange information and programs for graphing calculators, 
including many programs for the TI-82 and TI-85.  
 
Note: The information in this file was current as of August 1995. 
  
GRAPHING CALCULATOR INTEREST GROUP AVAILABLE BY E-MAIL 
------------------------------------------------------ 
  
Internet mailing lists work by providing an easy method to send e-mail 
to all other members of the interest group.  The mail may be an idea, a 
question, or the response to a question.  Long discussions on a topic 
often take place and all members can "listen" to the e-mail conversation 
and benefit from it. 
  
The lists are available to anyone with access to electronic mail on  
Internet, BITNET, and connected networks.  Most colleges and 
universities have this access and an increasing number of secondary 
schools have this access or are getting it. 
  
This lists were conceived to allow users of Texas Instruments graphing 
calculators to share ideas and solve problems together.  It is provided 
and support by Texas Instruments Incorporated through an AT&T managed 
computer. 
  
IMPORTANT INTERNET ADDRESSES 
  
There are several addresses which are associated with the Graph-TI and 
Calc-TI lists and the Graph-TI archive.  It is important that you not 
mix these up, or you may end up sending list server commands to the 
archive or even posting them to the list.  The following addresses are 
used to access the lists and the archive: 
 
Texas Instruments World Wide Web site: 
       HTTP://www.ti.com 
 
Graph-TI archive: 
       via e-mail:     mailserv@archive.ppp.ti.com 
 
       via anonymous ftp:      archive.ppp.ti.com 
(directory pub/graph-ti) 
 
       via gopher:     archive.ppp.ti.com (login as "gopher") 
 
Newsgroups: 
       Graph-TI Newsgroup:     bit.listserv.graph-TI

===================================================================== 
Question:      What are Graph-TI and Calc-TI? 
  
Graph-TI was created by Professor Bert Waits of Ohio State 
University and by Texas Instruments to provide a forum for 
free exchange of educational information regarding the Texas 
Instruments TI-81, TI-82, and TI-85 calculators and associated 
products.  It has various forms:  the Newsgroup, the list, and 
the archive.  The Newsgroup and the list allow subscribers from 
around the world to share information with each other relating 
to education and the TI calculators.  The archive is a collection 
of programs and documents for the TI calculators; anyone may submit 
programs to the archive or download programs from it. 
  
ONLY EDUCATIONAL TOPICS ARE ACCEPTABLE ON GRAPH-TI.  Please do 
not post anything to Graph-TI unless it is related to education. 
  
Calc-TI was created as a forum for discussion of topic related 
to all Texas Instruments calculators, but not related to education. 
It is in many ways similar to Graph-TI, except that all topics 
related to all Texas Instruments calculators are acceptable on 
Calc-TI.  Calc-TI, like Graph-TI, has two forms:  a list and a 
Newsgroup.  Note, however, that the Graph-TI archive serves 
both Graph-TI and Calc-TI.  There is no Calc-TI archive, and 
non-educational materials are allowed in the archive. 
  
The Newsgroups and the lists contain exactly the same information. 
Any information sent to one of the lists is automatically posted 
to the corresponding Newsgroup, and vice versa.  Therefore, there 
is no reason to subscribe both to a list and its Newsgroup. 
If you are able to subscribe to a Newsgroup, you should probably 
do so, since a Newsgroup has many advantages over a list. 
If you are not able to subscribe to a Newsgroup you should 
subscribe to the list. 
  
===================================================================== 
Question:      How do I subscribe to the Graph-TI or Calc-TI 
Newsgroup? 
 
The exact procedure varies among news readers and systems. In general, 
you will want to select bit.listserv.graph-ti (for Graph-TI) or 
bit.listserv.calc-ti (for Calc-TI) and tell the news reader to subscribe 
you. 
  
For example, if you are using the UNIX news reader trn and you want to 
subscribe to the Graph-TI Newsgroup, you should type: 
  
       g bit.listserv.graph-ti 
  
to select bit.listserv.graph-ti.  trn will note that you are not yet 
subscribed to bit.listserv.graph-ti, and will ask you if you want to 
subscribe.  Hit y and trn will subscribe you. The procedure for 
subscribing to the Calc-TI Newsgroup is the same, except you should 
type: 
  
       g bit.listserv.calc-ti 
  
====================================================================== 
Question:      How do I unsubscribe from the Graph-TI or Calc-TI 
Newsgroup? 
  
The exact procedure varies among news readers and systems. In general, 
you will want to select bit.listserv.graph-ti (for Graph-TI) or 
bit.listserv.calc-ti (for Calc-TI) and tell the news reader to 
unsubscribe you.  
 
For example, if you are using the UNIX news reader trn and you want to 
unsubscribe from the Graph-TI Newsgroup, you should type: 
 
       g bit.listserv.graph-ti 
 
to select bit.listserv.graph-ti, and then type u to unsubscribe from it.  
  
The procedure for unsubscribing from the Calc-TI Newsgroup is the same, 
except you should type:  
       g bit.listserv.calc-ti 
  
===================================================================== 
Question:      What are the Graph-TI and Calc-TI lists? 
  
The Graph-TI and Calc-TI lists are automated e-mail mailing lists.  
Postings to the Graph-TI list are sent directly to the e-mail address of 
each person who is subscribed to the Graph-TI list, and postings to the 
Calc-TI list are sent to all Calc-TI list subscribers. 
  
If you have access to Interment news, you probably would prefer to use 
the Newsgroups, rather than the lists.  See "What are the Graph-TI and 
Calc-TI Newsgroups?" for more information. 
  
===================================================================== 
Question:      How do I subscribe to the Graph-TI or Calc-TI list? 
  
To subscribe to the Graph-TI or Calc-TI list, send an e-mail message to 
majordomo@lists.ppp.ti.com.  The message should contain only the 
following line: 
  
       SUBSCRIBE {listname} 
  
You should replace {listname} in the above line by GRAPH-TI or CALC-TI, 
depending on which list you want to subscribe to.  The commands are not 
case-sensitive so you may mix upper and lower case letters.  Do not 
include the brackets.  Example:  you would subscribe to the Graph-TI 
list by sending the following line in an e-mail message to 
majordomo@lists.ppp.ti.com: 
  
       SUBSCRIBE GRAPH-TI 
 
===================================================================== 
Question:      How do I remove myself from the Graph-TI or Calc-TI 
list? 
  
To remove yourself from the Graph-TI or Calc-TI list (to "unsubscribe"), 
send an e-mail message to majordomo@lists.ppp.ti.com.  The message 
should contain only the following line: 
  
       UNSUBSCRIBE {listname} 
  
You should replace {listname} in the above line by GRAPH-TI or CALC-TI, 
depending on which list you want to remove yourself from.  Do not 
include the brackets.  Example:  to remove yourself from the Graph-TI 
list, send the following line in an e-mail message to 
majordomo@lists.ppp.ti.com: 
  
       UNSUBSCRIBE GRAPH-TI 
  
This should be sent from the same e-mail address used when you 
subscribed. If your e-mail address has changed since you subscribed, and 
you are no longer able to send mail from the original address, please 
send mail to: 
  
ti-cares@.ti.com explaining your situation. 
  
===================================================================== 
Question:      How do I find out about some of the list server's other 
capabilities? 
  
The list server understands more commands than the few (SUBSCRIBE and 
UNSUBSCRIBE) described above.  It is possible to get a list of 
subscribers to either list, and to do other things.  If you want more 
information about the extended capabilities of the list server, send an 
e-mail message to majordomo@lists.ppp.ti.com.  The message should 
contain only the word HELP. 
  
===================================================================== 
Question:      What is the Graph-TI archive? 
  
The Graph-TI archive is a collection of programs and documents for the 
TI-81, TI-82, TI-85 calculators, and associated products.  Anyone may 
download these programs, and anyone may submit programs to the archive.  
The archive, which is located at archive.ppp.ti.com, can be accessed 
through e-mail, anonymous ftp, or gopher. 
  
===================================================================== 
Question:      How do I access the Graph-TI archive through e-mail? 
  
The Graph-TI archive can be accessed by sending commands through  
e-mail. Such commands should be sent to mailserv@archive.ppp.ti.com.  
For a list of all available commands, send an e-mail message to 
mailserv@archive.ppp.ti.com.  The message should contain only the word 
HELP.  A help file will be mailed to you.  
  
For convenience, part of the help file is listed below: 
  
LS/DIR - Produce a directory content listing for each directory 
specified. A fully qualified pathname is required for each desired 
directory listing.  Each directory specified must exist on the DS 
server. 
  
       Examples:  ls /ftp/pub/graph-ti, /ftp/pub/graph-ti/misc 
  
                  dir /ftp/pub/graph-ti/TI-85 
  
A complete mapping of the public file space on the DS server is 
available in the /ls-lR file and may be retrieved as follows (the "file" 
command is discussed below): 
  
       Command:  file /ls-lR 
  
Note: 
The beginning (root) of the public file space is the /ftp directory. 
The anonymous ftp login changes the top of the file system to /ftp. 
This results in implicitly appending /ftp to all fully qualified 
file specifications.  The mail server always checks fully qualified 
file specifications for the leading /ftp.  If it is not found, it is 
appended by the mail server.  This allows an ftp user to give a tip 
on retrieving a file to a mail server user and have the mail server 
find and send the file.  The examples in this user guide use both 
forms. 
  
FILE - Request a particular file be transferred by e-mail.  It requires 
a fully qualified pathname for each desired file.  The file(s) specified 
must be in the public file space on the DS server.  The command fails if 
the specified file does not exist.  This is the best command for 
requesting files since there is no ambiguity when fully qualified 
pathnames are used. 
  
       Examples:  file /ftp/pub/Graph-TI/README. 
                  file /ftp/pub/Graph-TI/TI-85/archispi.85 
===================================================================== 
Question:      How do I access the Graph-TI archive through ftp? 
  
The Graph-TI archive accepts anonymous ftp logins.  You can access 
the archive through ftp by connecting to archive.ppp.ti.com and 
logging in with username "anonymous".  You should type your e-mail 
address as the password.  The programs are located in the pub/Graph-TI 
directory. Don't be alarmed if you encounter a disclaimer from AT&T, 
as they are running the archive for TI. 
  
===================================================================== 
Question:      How do I access the Graph-TI archive through gopher? 
  
There are two ways to connect to the Graph-TI archive with gopher. 
If you are running a gopher client, then point it to archive.ppp.ti.com. 
Select the menus 
  
       4. InterNIC Directory and Database Services (AT&T)/ 
               4. InterNIC Database Services (Public Databases)/ 
                       9. Graph-TI archive/ 
  
If you do not have a gopher client, then you may connect to the 
Graph-TI archive with a remote gopher client. You must telnet 
telnet to archive.ppp.ti.com and login as "gopher" (in all lower 
case letters, without the quotation marks). Then select the same 
menus as indicated above. 
  
To retrieve a file, look at the file, type q to quit browsing it, 
and then enter m to mail the file to your e-mail address.
