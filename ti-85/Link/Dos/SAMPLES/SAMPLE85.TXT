INTRODUCTION

This program computes the direction to point your ham radio antenna
to get best reception of a distant ham radio.

HOW TO USE BEAMHEAD

Given your longitude and latitude and the longitude and latitude of
another location, this program computes the compass direction and
distance in miles of the distant location.

Answer the program's prompts for latitude and longitude as a pair of
numbers in parentheses.  For example, the latitude and longitude of
Fairbanks, Alaska (65 degrees north, 147 degrees west) would be
entered as (65,147).  Southern latitudes and eastern longitudes are
entered as negative angles.

Store the latitudes and longitudes in variables to build up a data
base of city, country, and ham radio call sign locations.  For
example:

   (33,97)->Dallas
   (65,147)->Fairbank
   (47,71)->Quebec

The variable name of the location may then be entered at the prompt
for a location.

Example:  Compute the direction and distance from Dallas, Texas to
Fairbanks, Alaska.

  BEAMHEAD
  Origin (lat,long): Dallas       --Use [VARS] <CPLX> to quickly
  Dest (lat,long): Fairbank       --look up and enter the city names.
  Dist=
          3026.08610281
  Bearing=
          332o7'36.687"

The great circle distance from Dallas to Fairbanks is 3026 miles with
a bearing of 332 degrees.

INTRODUCTION

CASSE.85P is a version of the break-out video game for the TI-85 and has
been included just for fun and as an example of using the getKy programming
function.

HOW TO PLAY CASSE

The object of the game CASSE.85P is to "hit" all the "bricks" in the
display with the bouncing ball.  The user has control of the paddle along
the bottom of the screen and can move the paddle left and right with the
left and right cursor keys.  The game has 9 different levels of difficulty. 
After all the "bricks" are knocked out of one screen, the next level starts
automatically.  The user has four paddles before the game ends.

The program sets many "odd" modes.  It is suggested that you reset default
settings after you complete the game (or lose).  (You also can use the SAVER
and RESTORE programs, described later in SAMPLES.TXT.)

INTRODUCTION

Contour map grapher for the TI-85.  This program graphs a contour map
of an implicit function of X and Y.

HOW TO USE CONTOUR.85P

Define equation variable FXY with the implicit function before
running this program.

Modify the assignment to variable BAND in the first line of program
CONTOUR to adjust the Z axis width of each contour band.  Band is set
to .1 in the distributed version of CONTOUR.  This causes alternating
bands of black and white for a Z scale of .1

Run program CONTOUR.  Depending on the complexity of the definition
of FXY, the graph will be completed around 10 minutes.

Example:
   Graph the function F(X,Y) = exp(-sqrt((X-1)^2+Y^2)) +
                               exp(-sqrt((X+1)^2+Y^2)

   Enter on the home screen
      FXY=e^-abs(X-1,Y)+e^-abs(X+1,Y) [ENTER]

   Set the graph range to x: [-2,2], y: [-2,2] for a better view of
   this function.

   Run the program
      CONTOUR [ENTER]

   A contour map demonstrating two peaks at (-1,0) and (1,0) is then
   drawn.

This program uses a brute force test of pixels on the screen to
determine if the pixel should be turn on.  The program makes two
passes over the screen filling in a quarter of the pixels each time. 
You get a good idea of how the function looks after the first pass
and may stop the program from filling in detail on the second pass.

Included in the UUE section of this distribution is CONTOUR.85G, a
grouped TI-85 file containing CONTOUR (the contour plotting program),
FXY.85E (FXY as defined in the above example), and EXP2CON.85I (the
resulting contour map picture of FXY).

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

CONV2STR.85G is a group file containing REAL2STR.85P, CPLX2STR.85P, and
LIST2STR.85P.  These programs were written by Pat Milheron of the TI
Graphics Team and are released to the public domain.  You may copy and
change these programs.

INTRODUCTION

These three programs are utilities for converting real numbers to strings,
complex numbers to strings, and lists of real or complex numbers to
strings.

HOW TO USE REAL2STR.85P, CPLX2STR.85P, LIST2STR.85P

Each program assumes that the argument (real, cplx, or list) to be 
converted to a string is currently in Ans.  Each program loads the string 
result into Ans.  By using Ans to "pass" the data to and from these 
programs, they can easily be used as generic subroutines for larger 
application programs.  Below is an example of how to use Ans with REAL2STR:

    PROGRAM: MAIN
    : ...
    : 123.456 -> VAR1   (Ans is updated with the contents of VAR1)
    : REAL2STR
    : Ans -> STRING1    (Ans has the return string from REAL2STR)
    : ...

The REAL2STR.85P program is used as a subroutine call by CPLX2STR and
LIST2STR, and CPLX2STR is also a subroutine call for LIST2STR, so all 
three programs need to be resident in the TI-85.

INTRODUCTION

Many teachers have indicated to us that they want to have some common
statistical distributions available on calculators.  This TI-85 program is
an attempt to provide some common distributions for your use.  The program
provides calculations in the Standard-unit Normal, t, Chi-Square, F, Weibull,
binomial, Poisson, and hypergeometric distributions.  DIST is an
abbreviation for distributions.

HOW TO USE DIST.85P

DIST requires almost 7K bytes of memory.  When you run DIST, you must first
select the distribution you want from the menu.

GRAPH 3D FILES:

      1) D1, D2, D3..., D20
         These are the demo picture files used by the DEMO program.
         These files need to be loaded only if you wish to run
         the DEMO program.

      2) DEMO.85P
         This is the DEMO program that uses the above picture files.

      3) GR3D.85P
         This is the full featured graph 3D program.


HOW TO USE GR3D

1) Type "GR3D" and "ENTER" or press the "PRGM" key followed by
   the "F1" key and then selecting the appropriate menu function key
   designating the "GR3D" program.

2) If you wish to continue with the previous range settings from
   an earlier session, select "NO" at the "NEW CONFIGURATION"
   prompt.  For a new session with new range settings, select "YES"

3) Press "F1" key for a right handed coordinate setup of "F5" for
   a left handed coordinate setup.

4) If a right handed coordinate setup is selected (F1), you are
   prompted to select a tilt angle for the X axis.  If a left handed
   coordinate setup is selected (F5), a tilt for the Y axis is to be
   selected.  The tilt angle is customarily -135 degrees (zero
   degrees representing due east), although any tilt angle may be
   selected by the appropriate menu function keys.  The CUSTM key
   lets you enter any desired tilt angle.

5) Select a scaling option.  "SQR" is the standard scaling option
   which provides a one to one ratio for all axis.  The "FIT" option
   is more time consuming but gives a best view (enlarged and
   stretched) of the graph to fit on the screen.

6) Select "YES" or "NO" by pressing the appropriate menu function
   keys at the option to display the coordinate axis.  Note however,
   in the "FIT" option, the axis will be tilted with respect to the
   best fit view and may not APPEAR to be accurate.  The graph and
   axis displayed are however, accurately shown.

7) Select a working coordinate system at the "COORDINATE SYSTEM"
   prompt.  Valid choices are "F1" for Cartesian coordinates, "F3"
   for spherical coordinates, and "F5" for cylindrical coordinates.

8) Select the minimum and maximum values for the variables to be
   used in graphing the equation.  The increment may be defaulted by
   entering the number ZERO for this option.  By carefully
   incrementing the variables, speed and accuracy may be controlled.
   Incrementing a variable allows the program to successively choose
   new values for the variables and compute the values for the
   defined equation.  The default increment results in a total of 20
   traces to be plotted.

9) Enter the equation as you would normally write them.  Keep in
   mind however, that the variables X Y Z must be in uppercase.  The
   option "Z..." will the plot the function Z as is.  The function
   "Z=+-" will plot the functions Z and -Z.  This way, if you have a
   function such as Z=+- sqrt (X^2+y^2), you need not enter them as
   two separate equations.

10) Select an image rotation angle.  By selecting a rotation
    angle other than zero means to spin the image by actually
    spinning the Z axis the angle desired.  By rotating an image, you
    can examine parts of a graph that may not be visible in the tilt
    axis given.  For example, a paraboloid opening on the positive X
    axis in a right handed coordinate system (X axis tilted at -135
    degrees) rotated 90 degrees would now open on the positive Y
    axis.  Enter zero for no rotation.

11) Select the XYZ axis size.  The equation will not be plotted
    beyond the XYZ axis size unless a FIT graph was chosen.

12) After the equation is graphed, you may Zoom In, Zoom Out,
    perform a Zoom Fit or Zoom Sqr function.  The "Menu" option
    always returns to the main menu shown at the end of graphing an
    equation.  The "View" option simply eliminates the menu
    temporarily.  Press "ENTER", to return to the menu options.  The
    "REcfg" option lets you re-plot the equation with new range
    values along with other appropriate settings.  The "Graph" option
    will restart another graphing session.  The "Exit" option
    terminates the graphing session.

Note:  At the end of a graphing session, any equation plotted
       remains in view and may be stored to memory for later retrieval
       by pressing the "GRAPH" key, followed by the "STPic" menu
       function key and an appropriate file name.  Also, Greek symbols
       may be incorporated into equations for cylindrical and spherical
       formats by pressing "2nd" followed by the "CHAR" key, followed in
       turn by the "GREEK" menu key.  The program is case sensitive and
       thus requires the usage of "XYZ" versus "xyz".

INTRODUCTION

Many teachers around the country want a way of annotating graphs for
incorporation into a document via an .EPS or .TIF file.  GTEXT is an
abbreviation for "graph text".  The program allows the user to add text or
arrows to any graphical display.

HOW TO USE GTEXT

GTEXT works in any of the graph modes with any RANGE settings. Enter any
equations in the graph equation editor that you want to overlay text onto.
You can either graph it before running GTEXT or let the program graph it
for you.  The program (using "Smart Graph") will display a graph 
automatically at the start of execution.

Once the graph has been drawn, the main menu for GTEXT is displayed:

     -----------------------------------
    | QUIT |     | GRAPH | ARROW | TEXT |
     -----------------------------------

The general flow to using the program is:

1) Position the cursor using the GRAPH option from GTEXT main menu.
2) Choose either the ARROW or TEXT menu option.
   * If you have chosen ARROW, select the direction from which the arrow
     should point (8 choices).
   * If you have chosen TEXT, enter the text you want to display, followed
     by [ENTER].
3) The graph is updated with either an arrow or the text.
4) You can continue to add text or arrows by returning to step 1.

QUIT   Exits from program and saves graph in the picture variable NEWGRAPH.

       Note: If you use the ON key to "break" out of the program, the graph
       will not be saved in a picture variable.

GRAPH  Puts the graph into the screen with a free-moving cursor at the
       center of the screen.

       Move the cursor to the position on the graph where you want your
       text to start, or where you want the point of an arrow to be
       located.  For text, the cursor location will be the upper left
       location of the text to be written. All text is 5 pixels high and
       up to 5 pixels wide.  A pixel space is inserted between characters.

       Once the cursor location is chosen, press ENTER to "select" the
       location and return to the main menu.

ARROW  Allows you to draw an arrow with the point being located at the
       current cursor position. There are 8 different arrows that can be
       drawn, they differ only by their direction. Select the type of arrow
       from the arrow sub menus:

                           ^       |
                           |       |
         <----   ---->     |       v
        --------------------------------------
       |  LEFT | RIGHT |   UP  | DOWN  | MORE |

                                          v
        --------------------------------------
       | 1ST Q | 2ND Q | 3RD Q | 4TH Q | MORE |
        --------------------------------------
           /     \         ^      ^
          /       \       /        \ 
         v         v     /          \

       Note: Q is quadrant from which the arrow points at a 45 degree
       angle; v or ^ is the arrow head.

TEXT   Prompts you for text to be written on top of the graph.

       Text is normally written left to right from the current cursor
       position. Text can be written downward from the current cursor
       position by starting your text with the Greek letter lambda, which
       is located under the CHAR GREEK menu.

       The characters that can be written on the graph are limited in
       number in order to keep the size of this program to a minimum.  Any
       character not in the valid character set will just be skipped over.
       Lowercase letters are output as uppercase except x, y, r, and t.

VALID CHARACTER SET:
  Lowercase alphabet: (only x, y, r, and t are output as lowercase)
  Uppercase alphabet: A-Z
  Space
  Greek letters: theta,pi
  Numbers:  0-9
  Math operators: +  -  *  /  ^ =  negate (-)

INTRODUCTION

This program graphs an implicit function of X and Y formulated as an
inequality.

HOW TO USE IMPLGRAF

Define equation variable FXY with the implicit function before
running this program.  FXY should contain an inequality using
variables X and Y.

Run program IMPLGRAF.  Depending on the complexity of the definition
of FXY, the graph will be completed in 3-1/2 minutes (or more).

Example:
   Graph the inequality 16X^2 + 25Y^2 - 160X - 200Y + 400 < 0

   Enter on the home screen
      FXY=16X^2+25Y^2-160X-200Y+400<0 [ENTER]

   Set the graph range to x: [-2,12], y: [-2,12] for a better view of
   this conic.

   Run the program
      IMPLGRAF [ENTER]

   A filled-in ellipse is then drawn in the first quadrant.

This program uses a brute force test of (nearly) each pixel on the
screen to determine if the pixel should be turn on.  The program
makes two passes over the screen filling in a quarter of the pixels
each time.  You get a good idea of how the function looks after the
first pass and may stop the program from filling in detail on the
second pass.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

NELDER.85G is a group file containing NELDER.85P, NELDSORT.85P, and the
examples TESTNELD.85P and ORBIT.85P.  They were written by John Powers
and C. B. Wilson of the TI Graphics Team and are released to the public

INTRODUCTION

NELDER.85P and its associated subroutine NELDSORT.85P provide a nonlinear
minimization of a function with one or more parameters, using the
Nelder-Mead simplex method.  Nonlinear optimization is a very valuable
tool, especially for modeling and regression.  The Nelder-Mead method is
one of the most robust and therefore very suitable for experimentation and
use on a wide range of problems.  TESTNELD.85P and ORBIT.85P are
application examples for NELDER.85P.

HOW TO USE NELDER

NELDER should be called from a short program that sets up your problem. 
NELDER assumes that the variables to be minimized are in a vector X and
that you have a equation variable FX that computes the function that you
want to minimize.  The vector X must be initialized to a best guess for the
variables to be minimized.

NELDER uses the TI-85 system variable "tol" as a termination criterion. 
The iterations stop when the "size" of the simplex (roughly the "distance"
between vertices) is less than "tol".  At each iteration, NELDER displays
the action taken on that iteration (REFLECT, EXPAND, CONTRACT or SHRINK),
the loop count, a vector representing the value of FX at each vertex, and
the value compared to "tol" for termination.  There is no limit on loop
count; you can break the program if it appears it is not going to converge.
The most recent trial for X is averaged in "vavg" and the last actions
stored in "vref", "vexp" ,"vcon" and "vk".  At the beginning of NELDER is a
constant "offset", which is set to 0.1. This value is used to perturb your
initial guess to form the simplex and initialize the process.  If you know
your initial guess is much more accurate than 10%, you can prevent the
program "opening up" the scale too much by reducing "offset".  If you do
this often, you can remove the assignment statement from NELDER and put it
in your calling programs.

The example program TESTNELD.85P illustrates a simple use of NELDER. This
example fits a series of Fibonacci numbers to an equation of the form F(n)=
ae^(bn).  In the example program X(1) is "a" and X(2) is "b", the list NL
is "n" and list FN contains the exact Fibonacci sequence for the values of
"n" in list NL.  The equation for FX uses the sum of squares of error as
the minimization function.

If you use NL={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, FN={1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55} and tol
= 1e-5, you should get a least-squares error of .12339, X(1)=.4488077 and
X(2)=.4810062.  This is a good example of why nonlinear minimization is
required for accurate answers to tasks that are often treated in
"linearized" form due to people not having tools like this NELDER program. 
For instance, y=ae^(bx) can be linearized by ln(y)=ln(a) + bx and linear
least-square methods used to obtain ln(a) (hence a) and b.  However, these
values of a and b are biased by the fact that the sum of squares is
minimized in ln(y) and not y. We can see this effect quickly in the TI-85
by using exponential regression on the two lists above.  Since the
exponential regression is y=ab^x (linearized as ln(y)=ln(a) + ln(b)*x), we
just need to take the natural log of b as given by the TI-85 to have the a
and b that we want.  For the data above, we obtain a=.488296 and b=.468948.
Substituting these values for X(1) and X(2), we can evaluate FX to see that
the sum of squares error is 4.31 (vice 0.12).  If we want an equation for
calculating Fibonacci numbers: FIB=round(X(1) e^(X(2)*N),0), the
coefficients we obtained using NELDER will return the correct integer
values over the range of our data (and indeed up to N=14), while the
coefficients from the linearized least squares approach only work up to
N=8. In fact, if you try to fit the first 60 Fibonacci numbers with
linearized least squares, your coefficients will result in a sum of squared
error of 1.59e20.  Using these coefficients in the equation above only
results in one additional correct Fibonacci number for N=9. But with
NELDER, we can determine the coefficients X(1)=.44721359549739 and
X(2)=.4812118250597, which result in a sum of squared error of 0.299 and
exact results for N from 1 to 60.  The lesson here is that for accurate
data modeling to nonlinear equations, you really have to use a nonlinear
minimization tool.  While Nelder-Mead is not the fastest algorithm, it is
very robust, doesn't need any derivative information and isn't bothered too
much by discontinuities or other messy function behavior.

A second example, ORBIT.85P, fits data on variation in the period of pulsar
PSR1257+12 over time.  This data is approximate and obtained from the graph
shown in the announcement article, "A planetary system around the
millisecond pulsar PSR1257+12", Nature, Vol. 355, 9 January 1992, pp
145-147.  Another article covering this is "Pulsars, Planets and Pathos" in
Sky & Telescope, May 1992, pp 493-495.  The data is contained within the
program itself, as well as initial conditions for the optimization.  The
program fits 7 parameters to an equation, which is the sum of two sinusoids
and a constant.  Each sinusoid is described by an amplitude, a frequency
and a phase.  The time data is in years (actual year - 1990) and the period
data is in nanoseconds (actual period - 6,218,530 ns).  This problem is
pretty complex for this method, which is better for five or less
parameters, therefore the calculation time will be fairly long.  However,
it is an example of a realistic scientific problem that students have not
generally been equipped to solve.  From a sketch of the data points you can
determine possible values for the amplitudes and periods.  For instance,
one period seems to be about 0.2 year, so we would use 2*pi/0.2 = 31.4
radians as a possible starting point.

It is more difficult to make a close initial estimate of the phase angles
and if we just start with arbitrary values, it may take several hundred
iterations to get a result with tol=.001 or less.  Starting with the
somewhat better initial estimate in the program, setting "offset" in NELDER
to 0.01 and tol=.001, you can get the following result in 83 iterations.  A
comparable result with tol=.01 takes 59 iterations.

               First term       Second term
Amplitude        .0094215          .0067196
Frequency      34.7072           23.0665
Phase          -2.0107            3.2039
Constant        1.9339

Converting the two frequencies into days:
  365.25 days * 2ã / 34.7072  =  66.1 days
  365.25 days * 2ã / 23.0665  =  99.5 days

As reported in the Nature article, it is believed that two planets are in
orbit around this pulsar, having periods of 66.6 and 98.2 days. With
assumptions about the mass of the pulsar and this data, calculations for
the mass of these planets can also be made.

INTRODUCTION

SAVER.85P and RESTORE.85P are in the group SAVER.85G.  Many programs, such
as those on this disk, change the values of the RANGE variables and other
system variables, use common graphing equations, such as y1 and y2, or make
use of nondefault MODE and FORMT settings.  SAVER and RESTORE are an easy 
way to save all current graph databases and the user zoom and tolerance
variable values and then restore them and reset the MODE settings to the 
defaults.

HOW TO USE SAVER AND RESTORE

Run SAVER before running a program.

Run RESTORE after you have finished examining the results of a program,
such as a graph.

Note: You may include SAVER as a subroutine by typing the name as the 
first line of a program, but if you do, remember to run RESTORE before
running the program again or you will be saving the settings from the 
program instead.

The programs work by saving a graph database for each graphing mode,
and then restoring each.  It also saves the user zoom values and the
values of delta and tol and resets all modes to the defaults.  If you
normally use a nondefault mode, such as Degree or Fix 2, simply edit
RESTORE for your preferences.  All items created by SAVER begin
with "my" to make them easy to delete to free up memory later.

INTRODUCTION

TAYLOR is from Applications Chapter of the TI-85 Guidebook.  A slightly
altered version is included here to demonstrate transferring data with
programs for storage or sharing (see FREEWARE.TXT in \FREEWARE). In this
version, mSERIES is an existing list, rather than created by a subroutine,
as it was in the TI-85 Guidebook.  You must have both TAYLOR and mSERIES
in the TI-85 to run TAYLOR.

TAYLOR numerically calculates the Taylor polynomial of a function at a 
specified point.

HOW TO USE TAYLOR

TAYLOR prompts the user for a function, the order of the polynomial, and
the center point.  After calculating the polynomial, the original function
and the Taylor approximate polynomial are plotted in the standard window
([-10,10,1],[-10,10,1]).  The user can TRACE on both functions for
comparison of the error in the Taylor polynomial.
