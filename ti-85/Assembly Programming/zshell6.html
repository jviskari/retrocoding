</P>

<P>It's about time that you should know more than just program. You should also
know why things happens, and how it happens. For example, a computer (and a
calculator) understands machine code, 0 and 1. That's what the assembler does,
it translates the assembly language into machine code. The difference between
assembly languages and high level languages is that each assembly instruction
has it's own opcode, one or more bytes in a row that does exactly what you've
told it. In Pascal or C++ for example, every instruction is usually changed
into many opcodes. Many of those opcodes are usually unnecessary or could be
done in a smarter way. For example if you do a short for loop in a ZShell
program, you can use the B register and the djnz instruction, which is made
for that purpose. If you did a for-loop in Pascal or C++, it would use a
variable, a memory location, to store the counter. Each time the loop was
repeated it would load that value into a register, increase it with one, store
the variable, check if the limit is reached and then repeat if not end of loop
Guess why assembly language is faster...</P>

<P>On a Z80, the processor used by the TI-85 if you have forgotten, each
instruction (opcode) takes between 1 and 4 bytes. Small instructions are, of
course, generally executed faster, but there are 2 byte instructions that are
executed faster than 1 byte instruction (it depends on what the instruction
does). It's quite easy to guess how long each instructions is, which is useful
when optimizing your code. Each time you load a byte into a 8-bit register,
the size is two bytes; one byte to tell the processor that you should load an
immediate value into a 8 bit register, and one byte where that value is stored.
16-bit registers takes three bytes. Generally, all instructions that has one
byte takes two bytes, and the instructions using words (both as immediate
values and addresses) takes three bytes. Other instructions, such as loading
register A with E, takes one byte. All bit-manipulating instructions except the
logical instructions (and, or, xor, not) takes two bytes though. One prefix
($CB) and then the byte that tells what to do.</P>

<P>Now you know some more about how instructions really look like, which will help
in the future...</P>

</P>

<P>Aliases and Macros are used by the compiler and has nothing to do with
assembly languages actually, but they're used quite often since it makes the
source much easier to read. In TI-85.H there are lots of aliases and macros
(actually, there are only aliases and macros in it, plus comments).</P>

<P>You could probably guess what an alias is. If you type</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE> Three = 3</PRE></FONT>

<P>the compiler will substitute Three with 3 in the whole source code (when
compiling, it won't change the file itself). All "variables" in a program you
define in the beginning are just aliases. You could type those addresses in the
source code if you like that, but it's much easier to read if you make
aliases... Also, if you want to change an address, and have that address
located in many different places in the program, it would have been smarter to
make an alias of it. Then you would only have to change the aliases, not every
time in the source where the address occured.</P>

<P>Macros are similiar to aliases, and also similiar to subroutines sort of. To
make a macro in Table Assembler (if you use another assembler, CAZ for example,
you probably do it another way; read the documentation) you can type like this:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE> #DEFINE PushAll   push af \ push bc \ push de \ push hl</PRE></FONT>

<P>If you now type PushAll in your code, the compiler will replace it with
those four instructions (must be separated with a backslash). You can also
give parameters which is useful: (the parameters must be numbers, or aliases,
not registers or addresses)</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE> #DEFINE GotoXY(xy)  push hl \ ld hl,xy \ ld ($800C,hl) \ pop hl</PRE></FONT>

<P>Some examples on macros you use in almost every program are ROM_CALL(index),
CALL_(addr), JUMP_(addr). Just check ti-85.h and you'll see. The parameter in
the ROM_CALL macro is an aliases by the way. ROM_CALL(D_ZT_STR) could be replaced
with ROM_CALL(3), but it just makes the source harder to understand.</P>

<P>Creating your own macros is often useful, but remember that if you make a big
macro and use if often, it may make the source big... in the GotoXY example
above, the push hl \ pop hl part may be unnecessary if there were no important
things in the HL register. Macros should generally be small!</P>

<FONT SIZE=5>R</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>EGISTERS!</FONT>
</FONT>
</P>

<P>If you've programmed for a while you've probably quite often thought: "Damn,
I'm out of registers again!" It's a fact that the Z80 has few registers,
especially compared to the 68k processor which the TI-92 use... There are
actually, some more register you could use, though they have limitations. Here
they are:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><H3>The index registers IX and IY</H3></FONT>

<P>These registers are handy. The IY register is used by interrupts and rom
calls, and should not be changed unless you've disabled the interrupts (see
below). The IX register though is free to use anytime! It works almost exactly
like the HL register. When you can use the HL register, you can use the IX
register! There is one drawback though, the instructions become one or two bytes
longer, depending on the use. If you use IX as a dataregister in an instruction,
the instruction becomse one byte longer. That byte is a prefix ($DD) which tells
the processor that the next instruction will have IX in it, not HL! This is
necessary, because the opcode for an instruction which uses IX is the same as
for using HL. It's only the prefix that is the difference.</P>

<P>When you use the IX register as an addressregister, a pointer, it becomse two
bytes longer, the prefix and a shift byte. That shift byte is useful sometimes,
though most often you don't use it (but the instruction gets two bytes longer
anyway). The shift value is a signed byte and therefore has the limitation
-128..127.</P>

<P>Here are some examples:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 ld ix,$1234     ; IX=$1234 - one byte longer than ld hl,$1234
 ld (ix+5),62    ; Loads the byte 62 in the memory location IX+5.
                 ; If this instruction was executed right after
                 ; the previous one, it would mean at $1239
</PRE></FONT>

<P>If you don't use the shift byte, just (ix), you may still have to put it there,
(ix+0). I think you must do this on the CAZ assembler, but you don't have to
add that if you use TASM.</P>

<P>If you want to use the IY register, it works the same way. The only difference
is that the prefix is $FD instead of $DD. Remember to disable the interrupts
(see below)!</P>

<P>When you use the IX register (or IY) you can't use the HL register in the
same instructions (neither just H or L). For example, add ix,hl wouldn't work,
but add ix,ix works fine.</P>

<P>Maybe you've thought why the index registers aren't divided into two 8 bit
register, as HL. The answer is they are, there are just no instructions to
access those, or at least those instructions are not documented and not
supported by assemblers directly. Of course, if you type the opcodes for the
instructions it works just fine! First you should know what these 8 bit registers
are called. I don't know if this is the "real" name, but IXh, IXl and IYh, IYl
is used (h=higher byte, l=lower byte). The opcodes are quite simple... if the
assembler doesn't handle those instructions, type this:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 .db $DD \ ld a,h        ; If  you want to ld a,IXh
 .db $FD \ ld l,e        ; If you want to ld IYl,e
 .db $DD \ ld l,(hl)     ; This should be equal to ld IXl,(IX)
</PRE></FONT>

<P>The last one I'm not sure about, but it should work that way... try it
yourself.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><H3>The "not-so-often-used" R and I registers</H3></FONT>

<P>These registers are very seldom use, because they are very limited. The only
way to "communicate" with them is through the accumulator, so the only allowed
instructions are:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 ld a,r
 ld r,a
 ld a,i
 ld i,a
</PRE></FONT>

<P>What do they do? The R register is called the "Memory Refresh" registers
and is updated after every instructions (added with one), thus making
this register more or less a random register. The only real use for it is in
random generators, though it's not a good random generator... If you want a
random number between 0 and 15 (the range must be a power of two for good
generation, see below), you do like this:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 ld a,r  ; Loads the accumulator with the "random" register
 and 15  ; Masks off the unnecessary bits
</PRE></FONT>

<P>This works fine if you don't use if often. If you want 100 random numbers and
use this routine the randomize will be bad (if you randomize all numbers at once)!
It will be even worse if the range isn't a power of two. Let us say we want a
number between 0-6. How would you do? You can't type and 6 (figure this one out
if you're unsure about binary and masking) because then you would get a strange
result (only 0, 2, 4 and 6 would occur). The best way is to do like this:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
Random:
 ld a,r
 and 7          ; between 0-7
 jr z,Random    ; If it's 0, rerandom
</PRE></FONT>

<P>This works, and we'll get a random number between 1-7 (decrease with one to
get between 0-6). The problem is the frequency... one of the numbers will appear
2/8 of the time, the others 1/8. Why? Because every time the routine have to
rerandomize it means that the R register ends with 4 zeros (the last bit that
was shifted away plus the three masked bits). The newly randomized numbers will
then always be the same (should be 3 or 4 I think) because the number of
instructions are always the same.</P>

<P>How to fix this!?!? In ZTetris, the following simple random routine is used:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
Random:
 ld b,a
 ld a,r
 add a,a
 ld hl,0
 ld d,h
 ld e,a
RMul:
 add hl,de
 djnz RMul
 ld a,h
</PRE></FONT>

<P>The routine use the A register as input and generates a random number between
0 and A-1 using the A register as output as well. In short, the routine does
the following: A = A*(R/128). The R register is always a value between 0-127
(the upper bit is always cleared) so the result can't reach A (since the answer
is truncated) and if R is 0 the result becomes 0.</P>

<P>Back to the I register... this one is unimportant most of the time. It's only
useful when you program interrupt handler and stuff like that. It holds the
higher byte of the address which should be called when an interrups occurs and
you're in interupt mode 2. If you don't understand what I'm talking about, don't
bother... you don't need to know right now. It'll be better explained in another
lesson.</P>

<P>You can use it though as a temporary register if the interrupt mode isn't set
to 2. The interrup mode is usually set to 1, but when using grayscale graphics
it's set to 2, so then the calc would crash if you changed the I register (same
thing happens if Game Wizard or any other memory resident program is run)...
Since you can only change it through the A register, it's often not worth that
use though. One last thing also, you don't have to reset the register if you
change it. It's not used in the ROM memory. The TI-85 was never meant to use
the I register or interrupt mode 2. More about that in the lesson about
interrupts.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><H3>The shadow registers</H3></FONT>

<P>Now something cool... I think many will be surprised to know that there are
7 more 8 bit registers available to use! These registers are called the shadow
registers and are a copy of the common registers, A, BC, DE and HL. Their names
are similiar also, you add an ' after the register name: A', BC', DE' and HL'.
The drawback is quite big though, you can never access those register through
any instruction at all actually... There are instructions, however, that will
exchange the ordinary registers with the shadow register. Those instructions
are:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 ex af,af'    ; Exchange AF with AF' (F' = shadow flag register)
 exx          ; Exchange BC, DE and HL with BC', DE' and HL'
</PRE></FONT>

<P>When using these instructions you must have disabled the interrupts, because
they're used by the ROM. You don't have to restore them to what they were before
(no push/pop needed). To disable interrupts (and enable them again) you use two
short instructions:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 di     ; Disable interrupts
 ei     ; Enable interrups
</PRE></FONT>

<H4>Another useful exchange instruction</H4>

<P>I think I've missed a useful instruction before. Here it is:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 ex de,hl    ; Exchanges the contents in HL and DE
</PRE></FONT>

<P>It will only work on those two registers, and you must type ex de,hl not ex
hl,de (even though they would do the same thing). The instruction is useful
for example when you want to load DE and HL with two address like this:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 ld hl,Addr1
 ld bc,(PROGRAM_ADDR)
 add hl,bc             ; HL points to Addr1
 ex de,hl              ; Now DE points to Addr 1
 ld hl,Addr2
 add hl,bc             ; HL points to Addr 2

Addr1:
 dc.b "Address 1",0
Addr2:
 dc.b "Address 2",0

</PRE></FONT>

<P>This is the shortest way and fastest way in bytes to do that. Also, this is
an exception from the rule "whenever you can use HL you can use IX/IY" - you can't type</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 ex de,ix
</PRE></FONT>

<P>There are three more exchange instructions, but they all have to do with
the stack pointer, and are (usually) of less use. More about those in an upcoming appendix.</P>

</P>

<P>Now some very useful instructions which I've probably waited too long with
to explain. Have you never wanted to copy many bytes from one place to another?
In a simple way? For example copy the video memory to the graph memory or
something. Then you should use LDIR (or LDDR)! First LDI and LDD...</P>

<P>LDI is an instructions that does many things at once, you could say. It does
this:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 push af
 ld a,(hl)
 ld (de),a 
 pop af
 inc de
 inc hl
 dec bc
</PRE></FONT>

<P>It copes one byte from HL to DE (where they point) and increase both
pointers. LDD does the same except that both pointers are decreased. Both
instructions also decrease BC with one.</P>

<P>The LDIR (LDDR) instructions repeats the LDI (LDD) instruction until BC
becomes 0! If you want to copy 100 bytes from one place to another, just set
HL to the source and DE to the pointer and BC to 100 and run LDIR, and you're
done! Here's how to copy the video memory to the graph memory:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 ld hl,VIDEO_MEM
 ld de,GRAPH_MEM
 ld bc,1024    ; 1024 bytes to copy ($400)
 ldir
</PRE></FONT>

<P>Most often you use LDIR but sometimes LDDR is necessary.</P>

<P>There are also some other string instructions (that's what they're called)
which will be explained in another lesson.</P>

</P>

<P>Finally... I guess many have waited for this part. First I should explain
how grayscale graphics works. It's not something to do with hardware if anyone
though that. What you do is that you have two layers, two video memories. One
video memory is the original one (at $FC00) and the other one is 1024 allocated
bytes. To make it grayscale, those pages are flipped very fast, in 200 Hz. 2/3
of the time the video memory at $FC00 is shown and 1/3 of the time the other
video memory is shown. If a pixel is set on both layers, it is shown the whole
time (3/3) and becomes black. If it's only set on the first layer ($FC00) it's
visible 2/3 of the time and looks like darkgray. Only on the second layer, 1/3
of the time (lighgray) and if it's never visible, well, then it's white.</P>

<P>That's how it works. Here's how to use it in your very own program. It
requires that you use Rob Taylors excellent <A HREF="zsfiles/graylib.h">graylib.h</A>
