Welcome to the second lesson of the online ZShell School! Today you'll learn
a little about registers and how to store bytes, words and strings in the
memory. You'll also learn some common instructions so you will understand
the "Hello world!" program you wrote in the last lesson a bit better.</P>

In most programming languages you use variables to store information like bytes, integers,
strings and such. But, in assembly there is no such thing as a variable. So how do you do?
Inside each processor there are a few very quick ways to store information, the registers.
On a PC the most frequently used registers are AX, BX, CX and DX and on an Amiga they're
D0, D1, D2 and so on. What registers are there on a Z80, which is the CPU on a TI-85?</P>

<P>The <I>common</I> registers are called A, B, C, D, E, H and L (There are
other registers, though they aren't important right now). Pretty easy? They
are 8-bits registers, which means that you'll fit a byte in them. Now, how
do you do if you want to store a word for example? You "simply" put the
registers together two and two. There are three register pairs, called BC,
DE and HL. As you probably can figure out, the BC register uses both the B
and C register. Important also is that you can't combine the registers in
another way, ie registers such as BD, HA and so isn't possible. Also
important is that if you store something in the B register, it will be
destroyed when storing something later in the BC register, because they
are the same (sort of).</P>

<P>I forgot one thing in the last lesson that you'll need to know. When talking
about hexadecimal and binary, I forgot to tell you how you show that a number
is written in binary and hex. A hex number can either be written like this $5E
or like this 5Eh. Binary numbers are either written like this %11010001 or
11010001b. I use $ and % because I think it's easier to read the source then.
It's very important to know that there is <I>no whatsoever difference</I> between
94 - $5E - %01011101. It's just three different ways to write the same thing.</P>

<P>OK, back to how to store things in the memory. Since the registers are
few you'll need to know how to store things in the memory. This method is
a bit slower, so numbers you often use you should store in the registers
more often. All calculations require that at least one of the numbers you
want to add or sub is stored in a register. Anyway, since the RAM memory
is 32k, how do you know where in the memory it's safe to store things? You
don't want to write to some location in the memory where other programs
are stored because then you will get bad checksum when trying to run those
programs. Lucky for us is that there are a few places in the memory that
aren't used by the TI when where not in TI-OS. One of those places
are the text memory, which starts at address $80DF. There you'll fit 8x21
(the text screen size) = 168 bytes. The reason you can use the text memory
as storage is that when writing something to the screen, you write it directly
to the LCD memory, not via the text memory as I think the ROM does. You don't
have to understand this really, you just need to know that you're able to
store things in the text memory. Other places to store things in is the second
text memory (168 byte, starts at $8A6B) and the graph memory (1024 byte, starts
at $8641). You can't use the whole graph memory when using Rob Taylors
grayscale routine though, because then the calc will crash. First you should
use the text memory, then the second one and last the graph mem. Of course,
if you need to store big arrays, it's perhaps necessary to use the graph mem.
</P>

<P>What if you have <I>many</I> variables? How do you do then? 168+168+1024
= 1360 bytes isn't <I>that</I> much. Then you can store it directly in
the program. The disadvantage of this is that the program gets bigger
(since you allocate space in the program) and it's more complicated to
access that information, since you don't know the exact location of the
variables. There are other methods, but it requires that you know how
the TI-85 works internally.</P>

<P>OK, that was a big explanation of this. Now, how do you use it practically?
First you need to now how to explain that you mean a memory address instead
of a word. The way to to this is that you put ( ) around the address, for
example ($80DF). Then the compiler will now that you mean the <I>contents
of the RAM memory at address $80DF</I>, not just the number $80DF.</P>

<A NAME="ld"></A>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF8000">
<FONT SIZE=5>LD<FONT SIZE=4>, THE MOST COMMON INSTRUCTION</FONT></FONT>
</FONT><BR>

As you saw in the previous lesson, ld is used very often. What does it do?
Not so hard to guess actually. LD stands for Load, which means that you
store the second argument in the first argument. Example: ld a,53 stores
53 in the A register. Now there are a couple of different ways to do this.
A list below show you some ways to use ld.</P>

<UL>
<LI>ld d,63
<LI>ld bc,$7A3B
<LI>ld ($80DF),a
<LI>ld a,($80F5)
<LI>ld b,(hl)
<LI>ld (de),a
<LI>ld ($8641),hl
</UL>

<P>You can probably guess what these instructions will do. As you see
I always use the hexadecimal form when I use address location. You should
do that, because that is standard. When you store words in the memory
(the last of the ld instructions above), the word is stored "backwards".
In the case above, the L register would be stored at ($8641) and the H
register at ($8642). ld bc,$7A3B will store $7A in the B register and
$3B in the C register though.</P>

<P>Sadly, there are some rules you must follow when using ld. Some things
that aren't allowed are listed below.</P>

<UL>
<LI>You are not allowed to store a 16-bit registers in a 8-bit registers
and vice versa.
<LI>You can't load a 16-bit reg with another 16-bit reg. ld bc,hl isn't
allowed with other words. You have to ld b,h and ld c,l to do that.
<LI>When you use a direct memory addressing, ($80F5) for example, the other
register must be A or a 16-bit register. ld b,($80F5) is not allowed but
ld bc,($80F5) is allowed. Note that (hl) is <I>not</I> a direct memory
addressing.
<LI>An important thing to know is that (hl) acts <I>exactly</I> like other
8-bit registers (with the exception that the A reg is a bit special). You
could say that it's an 8th register (which, in fact, it is if you look
at how the opcodes are made). When I say "only registers", I always mean
that (hl) is also possible. Because of that, hl is very often used as a memory
pointer.
</UL>

<P>I think that covered the registers we've been through so far. When the
other registers are introduced I'll explain how do use them.</P>

There are a few other instructions that are easy to use that you should
now.</P>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=4>Add</FONT></FONT><BR>
Add does an addition. Simple? Yes, except that there are limitations of
course. The first arg <I>must</I> be the A reg (if you want to make a
8-bit addition) or HL (16-bit addition). If the first arg is A, then
the second arg can be a direct value or a 8-bit register (remember that
(hl) acts like an 8-bit register), <I>not</I> a memory location! If the
first arg is HL, the the second arg <I>must</I> be a 16-bit register! Add
hl,hl is also possible. The answer is <I>always</I> stored in the first
register. Some example of correct additions are listed below.</P>

<UL>
<LI>add a,7
<LI>add a,(hl)
<LI>add a,c
<LI>add hl,bc
</UL>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=4>Inc and Dec</FONT></FONT><BR>
Inc and dec are very useful when you want to make small additions or
subtractions. They only have one arg, which is a register, 8-bit or 16-bit.
Worth notifying is that if you want to add a 8-bit reg (excluding A) with
3, it's smarter to Inc that register three times, because if you for example
want to add the C reg with 3, you have to ld a,c \ add a,3 \ ld c,a. That
takes four byte (you'll see that if you look at the opcodes of the instructions.
It's very good to have a book with opcodes when programming) but inc c \ inc c \
inc c only takes three bytes. When it comes to 16-bit reg, it's even more
useful to use Inc, especially when you want to add bc with de for example.
</P>

<P>Dec works exactly like Inc, but since Sub (see below) is even more limited
than Add, you can use many Dec in a row and still it takes lesser bytes
than a sub would have done.</P>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><FONT SIZE=4>Sub</FONT></FONT><BR>
As I said, subtraction is even more limited than addition. That's because
you <I>must</I> sub from the A reg. Because of that, you only have one arg,
which can be a 8-bit reg or a byte. But what do you do if you want to make
a 16-bit sub? Well, there is a trick you can use. There are a 16-bit sub,
but it requires that you clears the Carry flag (more about flags in the
next lesson). If you want to sub hl with de, you do like this: or a \ sbc
hl,de. Or a is the easiest way to clear the carry. What or really does
will be explained in a later lesson.</P>

Let us first look at the program again.</P>

</PRE></UL></FONT>

<P>You should understand the beginning. The reason why we store $0000
in <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">(CURSOR_ROW)</FONT> is because <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">CURSOW_ROW</FONT>
is the alias for $800C, and at that memory location holds the current cursor position. Since you
store a word, both ($800C) and ($800D) will be 0. That's good since ($800C) contains the y-pos
and ($800D) contains the x-pos. 0,0 is the top left corner on the screen.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">ROM_CALL(D_ZT_STR)</FONT> displays a zero terminated string
with start at HL. Then we must first load HL with the correct address. The string we
want to display are stored last in the program (good place for storing constants).
<FONT COLOR="#FF8000">ld hl,Text</FONT> loads hl with the <I>relative</I> address to the string.
The origin of the program is at the start, where <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">.org 0</FONT> is. Then
we add that address with <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">(PROGRAM_ADDR)</FONT>, which holds where in the
memory our program is. So, <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">(PROGRAM_ADDR)</FONT> holds the address where
<FONT COLOR="#FF8000">.org 0 is</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">Text</FONT> holds
the address where the string we want to output is with <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">.org 0</FONT> as zero.
If you add these two addresses together, you get the <I>absolute</I>
address to the string, which is what we want.</P>

<P>The last part may be a bit cryptic, but it waits until the exit key
is pressed. More about those instructions in the next lesson.</P>
