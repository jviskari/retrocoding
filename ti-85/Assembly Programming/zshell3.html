Welcome to the third lesson of the online ZShell School! In this lesson you'll learn how to compare registers
with each other and how to do loops. To know this you must also know a bit about flags and what they
are for. I will also explain what the "famous" ROM_CALLs really are and some advantages and disadvantages
with the use of ROM calls.</P>

Flags are very important. If you want to know what happened in the last instruction for example, you must check how
the flags are set. Most of the instructions executed by the processor will modify some or all of the flags. So, how many
flags are there on a Z80 CPU, and what do they do? The Z80 has 6 flags but you seldom use
any other flag than the Zero Flag and the Carry Flag.</P>

<P>A flag can either be set or cleared, depending on the last instructions that changed that flag. That means that 6 flags
only takes 6 bits which fits in one byte, and that is how they're stored. You may have noted why the A registers doesn't
have a "brother"? It has, and that registers is called the flag register (F) and the register pair is logically called AF then,
though you can never do anything with the pair except push and pop (explanation in the next lesson).</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>The Zero flag</FONT>
</FONT><BR>

The Z flag is used to indicated whether the value of a byte which has been computed, or is being
transferred, is zero. It is also used with comparison instructions to indicate a match, and for
other miscellaneous functions. For example, if you decrease a 8-bit register (with DEC) and the
registers reaches 0, the zero flag will be set. Note that if the registers doesn't reach zero,
the flag will be cleared. The Z flag will also be set or cleared when using dec, inc, add and
sub. Note that ld doesn't affect the Z flag. In fact, ld does <I>never</I> change <I>any</I>
flag.</P>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF8000">
<FONT SIZE=4>The Carry flag</FONT>
</FONT><BR>

The C flag is used to indicate whether an additon or subtraction operation has resulted in a
carry (if an 8 bit addition results in a 9 bit answer) or a borrow (if the answer is negative).
The C flag is also used as a ninth bit in the case of shift and rotate operations, which will
be discussed in the next lesson. Remember that all arithemtic, shift and rotation operations
will either set or clear the C flag, depending on the result.</P>

The table below shows some examples on how the Zero and Carry flag works. The abbreviations
ZF (Zero Flag set), NZ (No Zero), CF (Carry Flag set), NC (No Carry) are used to
show the result. - means that the flag is unaffected.

So, now you know a bit about flags, but how do you use them? There must be some instructions
that checks the flag, else it would be pretty useless. Luckily, there are plenty of such
instructions, and most of them are jump or call instructions. There are two kind of jump
instructions, relative jumps and absolute jumps. The calls are always absolute. The relative
jumps are much faster and a bit smaller (3 bytes because of the way ZShell works), but the
relative jumps has a limit: you can only jump 129 bytes forward and 126 bytes backwards.
In most cases that is sufficient, and you should always try relative jumps until the compiler
give you an error ("Relative branch to long" or something like that). Then you should change
to absolute jumps. The calls are ordinary subroutine calls, and the instruction ret will return
to where the call was. Of course you can jump and call without bothering about the flags.</P>

<P>Now, what does this stuff mean? First, when programming ZShell you should only use the second column. Those instructions
are just aliases (that you'll find in ti-85.h) for a jump to ZShell, which then jumps to the specified label. The reason for this is simple:
As I've said before, all variables (except zshell.85s) are moving around in the memory when creating, deleting or changing variabels, so
when you compile your program, you never know where in the memory your program will be, but you do know the relative address, and since
ZShell knows where in the memory your program is, it's easy to do far jumps.</P>

<P>Second, you need to know which conditions you can use. Well, only four, but you probably don't need any more. They are
NZ (not zero), Z (zero), NC (not carry) and C (carry). Actually, the Z80 supports four more conditions which you only can use
with jp, but ZShell doesn't support those. If you don't want any condition, just skip that part of the instruction (ex: jr JumpHere). A simple
program example follows.

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><UL><PRE>
 ld a,12
 sub c
 jr z,CIsTwelve
 .
 .

CIsTwelve:
 .
 .
</PRE></UL></FONT>

Hopefully, you can guess what this program does. First, A is loaded with 12 and then subtracted with C (whatever it contains).
If C equals A, then the result will be zero and the Z flag will be set, and then a jump will be made to CIsTwelve, else the program
will continue directly after jr z,ClsTwelve. Perhaps I should say that labels (like CIsTwelve) doesn't take memory, so you could
make a label for every row (like early basic...) if you want, but that would only make your program harder to read.</P>

<P>If you want to know how the rest of the jump and call functions look like, you should study ti-85.h, because you should be able
to understand the comments. It's really simple.</P>

</P>

<P>In the above example, you subtracted two registers to check if they were equal, and if they were the Z flag was set. That's logical
because when subtracting two equal numbers the result is zero. There is one drawback though: the contents of A will change, which
isn't so fun most of the time. Then we use another instruction, cp (<I>c</I>om<I>p</I>are), which works exactly like sub, <I>except</I>
that the answer isn't stored in A! The only thing that happens is that some flags are set (we are only interested in the Z and C flag though).
Now that's very good! Now we can easily check if two registers contains the same value. We can also compare the A registers with a
numerical value (cp works exactly like sub, and the limitations are the same).</P>

<P>But what if we want to check if the D register is greater than the A register? What will happen when we compare?
The Z flag won't be set because the subtraction won't be zero, but if D is greater than A, then the answer would be negative, right?
And what happens then? Yes, the C flag will be set! If D is equal or lesser than A, the C flag will be reset. A table below shows all cases.</P>

<P>All programs probably uses loops. You almost always want you program waiting for something or repeating some instructions while waiting on something
to happen, for example a key press. In the last case, you have to compare the scancode with the key you're waiting for. Example below:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><UL><PRE>
WaitKey:
 call GET_KEY   ; Calls a routine in the rom that gets the last
                ; key pressed and stores the scancode in A.
                ; If no key pressed since last call, A=0.
                ; Note that the routine doesn't wait for a key.
 cp K_EXIT      ; Compares A with the scancode for the exit key
 jr nz,WaitKey  ; If the answer isn't zero (A <> $37), jump
                ; back and check again.
</PRE></UL></FONT>

<P>Sometimes you know how many times the loop should be reapeting, for example when making a line with the width of 20 pixels. One
simple way to do this is to have a counter which starts at 20, and at the end of the routine, you decrease it and check if it's zero (of course
you can start from zero and increase, but then you have to check if the counter has reached 20 with the cp instructions which isn't needed
when using dec, since dec will set the Z flag when the register has reached zero). But for this case the Z80 has a special instruction for us,
which both decreases, sets the Z flag if necessary and makes a relative jump if the Z flag isn't set. That instruction is called djnz (<I>D</I>ecrease,
<I>J</I>ump <I>n</I>ot <I>z</I>ero), and the syntax is <I>djnz label</I> (it's my favourite instructions btw, because it "looks" cool and is fun
to pronounce :-).</P> But wait! How do we tell which register do decrease? Well, we don't. Djnz always decreases the B register, and that's
why the B register is very often used as a counter. Of course another problem arises now, what if we want to loop, lets say, 1000 times? B is
only a 8 bit registes so it won't work. One way is to use a 16 bit register and decrease it with dec, another is to nestled loops, but then you
must save the B reg. Two different examples below:</P>

<P>If you want to use the left version, you can use push and pop instead of using the C register. Of course, the right version is shorter and
faster, but sometimes you may prefer the left version.</P>

<P>If you want to move memory from one location to another, there are some other useful instructions, <I>ldir</I> and <I>lddr</I>, but
I'll explain them in another lesson.</P>

<P>Yeah, what is a rom call really? I've seen some people saying: "How do we do that? With a rom_call maybe?". That shows that people
think they're powerful tools, and sure, they are, but ZShell doesn't support so many, and you normally don't use too many of them. So, what
happens?</P>

<P>What we do is that we use routines that already exists (why reinvent the wheel?), and that saves a lot of memory. For example, to display
a string, you need a lot of instructions: you must take the first letter, look up the font, put out the correct character, and update the cursor. All
this takes about 1500 bytes (font included) I guess, so it's rather smart to use a routine that's already done and is stored in the rom, wouldn't
you say? Another thing: in the program above I used call GET_KEY. Observe that I used call, which means that I know exactly where the
routine is stored, which means that the get key routine is at the same place in all ROM versions (yes, GET_KEY and some other calls
in the ti-85.h are ROM calls though it doesn't "look" like one). That's not the case with D_ZT_STR (Display Zero-terminated Text String), because
it's at different places in the ROM depending on the ROM version. Therefor, a call to ZShell must be made which finds out where the absolute
address is and then jumps to the right offset. In fact, all ROM_CALLs should be called ZSHELL_CALLs, because first a call is made to ZShell,
then a <I>jump</I> is made to the ROM... The real ROM calls are GET_KEY and those... ;-)</P>

<P>To find out which ROM calls you should use, read ti-85.h and the ZShell Function Library (in the ZShell package I believe) where a
short explanation describes what happens, which registers are affected and some traps.</P>
