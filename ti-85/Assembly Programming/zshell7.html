<P>Welcome to lesson #7 of the online ZShell school! At this stage you should
know most of the instructions the Z80 processor can handle, and a summary of all
instructions would be quite handy, don't you think? I've zipped together two textfiles
with a short summary over the official Z80 instruction set - press

<P>The previous lesson was just an introduction to grayscale, explaining how it worked. In this
lesson some useful routines are presented. It should be very easy to understand if you understood
what I meant about layers and two video memories in the previous lesson. If not, you should reread
that section.</P>

<P>We start with something simple: a putpixel routine, lets call it PutPixelG. Input arguments
should be coordinates and the color of the pixel; 0 being white and 3 black. The routine should
check on which layers the pixel should be put. If the pixel is black it should be put at both
layers. Here's the code, with comments: </P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
PutPixelG:            ; B,C = x,y coordinates
                      ; D = color (0-white, 3-black)
 ld a,63              ; Convert the y coordinate so
 sub c                ; y=0 is the top row, not the bottom row
 ld c,a               ; (FIND_PIXEL) works that way
 ROM_CALL(FIND_PIXEL) ; Get the offset to the pixel to be put
 push hl              ; Store the offset on the stack
 ld e,a               ; Store the value of bit to change
 ld bc,$FC00          ; Address to layer 1
 add hl,bc            ; Add with offset to get pixel location
 or (hl)              ; Put pixel
 bit 1,d              ; Check if D=2 or D=3
 jr nz,PPG1           ; If the bit is set, don't remove pixel!
 xor e                ; Remove the pixel.
PPG1:
 ld (hl),a            ; Make the update in the video memory
 pop hl               ; Restore the pixeloffset
 ld a,e               ; Plus the bit value
 ld bc,(Page2Addr)    ; Page2Addr points to 2nd layer
 add hl,bc            ; Add with offset to get pixel location
 or (hl)              ; Put the pixel
 bit 0,d              ; Check if D=1 or D=3 (then bit 0 is set)
 jr nz,PPG2           ; Skip the removing part if bit 0 is set
 xor e                ; Remove the pixel
PPG2:
 ld (hl),a            ; Update the second layer
 ret                  ; End of routine
</PRE></FONT>

<P>When the routine returns to where it was called, all registers are changed. If you don't like this,
put in pushes and pops at the beginning and the end of the routine. Also, don't forget ld a,4 \
out (5),a at the beginning of the program! Else the program will crash when FIND_PIXEL is
executed.</P>

<P>The routine uses quite a lot of logical operators and bit instructions. I also think I missed some
instructions in lesson #4 (the one about bits and logical operators) , one of them used in the routine
above: BIT. BIT checks if a certain bit is set in an 8 bit register.
If the bit is set, the zero flag is cleared. If it's not set, the zero flag is set. Similiar instructions
are SET and RES. Both have the same arguments as the BIT instructions, but SET sets a bit in
an 8 bit register and RES removes the bit. One sad thing about these instructions are that the bit
must be a constant. You can't use a register for the first argument. Example: BIT A,B isn't possible.
If the instruction did exist, some routines could be optimized in both speed and size.</P>

<P>Back to the routine above... there is a little trap in it. If you want to put a pixel in color
(darkgray), a pixel should be lit at the first layer. But it's very important to clear the bit at the
second layer! If it was set before calling the routine, you would end up with a black pixel instead.
The routine above actually first always puts the pixel, then removes it if it should be removed.
The instruction used to put a pixel is OR and to remove it I used XOR. You could remove the pixel
with the AND instruction also, but it would require more bytes (and it wouldn't be faster) to write
such a routine.</P>

<P>Note also that you can use this routine to remove pixels, although you could make a routine
that only removed pixels (would be slightly faster). If you want fast graphic routines, you shouldn't
use a putpixel routine every time you want to put a pixel (I'm thinking of line routines and sprite
routines) because it would be slow since you must call FIND_PIXEL every time which is very
unnecessary.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#FF8000"><H3>Grayscale sprite routine</H3></FONT>

<P>One very easy way to do a grayscale sprite routine is to use an ordinary PutSprite routine
twice and just change the address to the layer... that's what I'm going to do in this section.
I'm going to use my own PutSprite routine (found <A HREF="zshell5.html#sprites">here</A>), but
you should be able to do the modification quite easily on any sprite routine.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>

 pop hl
 pop de
 pop bc

</PRE></FONT>

<P>You must also change this section in the PutSprite routine:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 ld de,$FC00    ; Remove this row!
 add hl,de
 ex de,hl
 pop hl
 ld b,(hl)      ; Change these four rows
 inc hl         ; |
 ld c,(hl)      ; |
 inc hl         ; |
</PRE></FONT>

<P>into</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
 add hl,de
 ex de,hl
 pop hl
 push ix
 pop bc
</PRE></FONT>

<P>If you want to use the PutSprite routine to put ordinary black&white sprites, you must change
the input registers so DE points to the video memory ($FC00) and IX are the x and y dimensions
of the sprite. HL should also point to the spritedata, not the coordinates. It's easier though make
another small routine that fixes this:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
PutSpriteBW:
 push bc
 push de
 push hl
 ld d,(hl)
 inc hl
 ld e,(hl)
 inc hl
 push de
 pop ix
 ld de,$FC00
 CALL_(PutSprite)
 pop hl
 pop de
 pop bc
 ret
</PRE></FONT>

<P>If you for some reason want both black&white and grayscale sprites in the same program you
should use the routines above. PutSpriteBW works exactly the same way as the unmodified
version of PutSprite. Both PutSpriteG and PutSpriteBW uses the modified version of PutSprite.
I made a file containing those three routines with how-to-use instructions. Press
<A HREF="zsfiles/sprlib.h">here</A> to get it.</P>

<P>You must also know how to store grayscale sprites. To get it to work in my grayscale sprite
routine, and in all other grayscale sprite routines available, you must store the layers after each
other! It's therefore hard to see what the sprite really is if you just look at the .db:s. When drawing
the sprite, draw it on a piece of paper (or a drawing program) first, then divide the layers.</P>

<P>Example:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
Sprite:
 .db 8,8
 .db %11111111
 .db %11111111
 .db %00000000
 .db %00000000

 .db %00000000
</PRE></FONT>

<P>The sprite looks like four horitonzal rows with the colors black, light gray, white, and last
darkgray. The first 8 rows (or 6 rows if the ysize is 6) contains the first layer and the last 8
rows the second layer. A black pixel should have a pixel set on both layers, a white on none.</P>

<P>That was all about grayscale for this time. If you want a grayscale line routine for example,
try change the b&w line routine the way I changed the PutSprite routine above.</P>

<P>Input routines are very seldom used in ZShell applications so far. One reason is that in most
applications it hasn't been necessary. But the most important reason is probably because input
routines aren't that easy to write. It's much easier (and takes less memory) to write a routine
where you change the letters with the arrowkeys.</P>

<P>How can an input routine be hard? Well, you have to read each char seperately, and if you
want a backspace feature it becomes even harder. But adding a blinking cursor after the last char
is MUCH easier. How can that be!? Well, the blinking cursor is cheating really... the ROM does
everything for you. You just have to turn the cursor on with one simple instruction and turn it
off when done. It's not THAT easy, but almost.</P>

<P>Before showing the routine a new set of instructions must be explained: CPI, CPIR, CPD and
CPDR. It's the same kind of instructions as LDIR and those, and the difference between them is
the same.</P>

<P>CPI compares the A register with the byte at (HL). After that HL is increased and BC is 
decreased. The Zero flag is set if A=(HL), else it's cleared. CPIR repeats CPI until either
the Zero flag is set or BC becomes 0. CPD and CPDR does the same thing except that HL
is decreased instead of increased.</P>

<P>These instructions are extremly helpful if you want to check where in an array a certain
value is stored. For example, let A=5, BC=10 and HL point to an one-dimensional array. Then
you make a CPIR. If after the instruction the Zero flag is NOT set, none of the 10 bytes in the
array was equal to 5. If the Zero flag was set and BC has become 7, the 2nd (10-7-1) position in the
array is equal to 5. The reason it's the 2nd position (not the third) is that BC is decrease even
if A = (HL).</P>

<P>How can this be used in an input routine? If you check the TI-85.H file you see that the 
keycodes to the alphabet are in very disorder: A = $2E, B = $26, C = $1E, ... ok, there is
a pattern, but to convert it to ascii chars makes the routine bigger than if you use CPIR.</P>

<P>As you saw in the example above, BC becomes backwards. If BC=0 (and the Zero flag is
set) it's the last byte in the array that was equal to A. If the array contained the alphabet
in alphabetic order and the A register contained the keycode to Z, BC would be 0. Then you
had to do a subtraction with 90 (the ascii code for Z) followed by a NEG instruction. We could
save one byte by reversing the alphabet. Instead of subtracting and negatating, only one addition
is needed (with 65, ascii code for A).</P>

<P>Now you should understand the input routine. The rows with an explanation starting with a star
(*) can be removed if you don't want a blinking cursor. Read the explanation before the routine
so you know how to use it and some traps. The letters you enter will be in textmode (menustyle
is MUCH harder since the size of the letters are different). Backspace (left arrow) is also supported.

; Input routine  - made by Jimmy M&aring;rdell 97-03-05
;
; Reads a sentence entered from the keyboard. Only uppercase
; letters and space are allowed. Left arrowkey = backspace.
;
; When calling, HL should point to where the string should
; be stored and A should hold the maximum length of the
; string. Be sure there are enough space (A+1) to store the
; nullterminated string at HL! ($800C) should hold the screen
; position where the string starts.
;
; This input routine will also have a flashing cursor. If you
; don't like it, remove all rows where the explanation starts
; with a *.
;
; IMPORTANT: The input must NOT wrap to a new row! Then it
; will not work properly. The last char on a row should not
; be used either (if cursorcol=0 when calling, the maximum char
; length is 20). If you have a cursor, the two last chars should
; not be used (max length 19 if the screen location starts to
; the far left).

<P>If there were no such things as ports, a microprocessor would just do invisible calculation. 
Ports communicate between the processor and hardware stuff such as the keyboard and the
linkport. Assembly is low level language, but programming with ports is <I>really</I> low level.
To read a key in ZShell, you most often use GET_KEY. But how does GET_KEY work? It reads
a byte in the RAM (probably the one stored at $8006 - LAST_KEY or $8000 - KEY_0). That byte
read is the key scancode. But how did it get there? To understand that you must know a bit of
what interrupts are. At a frequence of about 200 Hz (depends on the batteries) certain routines
are called in the ROM. These routines (interrupthandlers) are called whatever the processor
is doing; in the middle of a calculation, waiting for the user to press a key, or running a ZShell
game - the only exception are if the interrupts have been disabled. The interupthandlers are
quite small though, and they never disturb the program in any way (no change in registers or
flags or anything). But they do change some things in the RAM memory - among them the
address where GET_KEY gets the key scancode from. One interrupt handler reads from a port 
which key is currently pressed down and converts that information into a scancode which is
stores in the RAM memory, ready for GET_KEY to pick up.</P>

<P>On the TI-85 there are 8 ports, numbered from 0-7. Some are unused, some have known
functions and some are unknown. You can both send and receive stuff from ports though some ports are read only and some are write only. Port 1 is used by the keyboard and port 7 by the
linkport.</P>

<P>The instructions used to communicate through ports are mainly OUT and IN. OUT sends a
byte trough a port and IN receives a byte from a port. The syntax for OUT is either</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>out (n),A</PRE></FONT>

<P>where n is the port and A is the accumulator, or</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>out (C),r</PRE></FONT>

<P>which sends an 8 bit register r through the port stored in register C. The syntax for IN is the 
same, except that the arguments are swapped (the destination register comes first, then the 
port).</P>

<P>Some other instructions connected to ports are OUTI, OUTD, OTIR, OTDR, INI, IND, INIR
and INDR. All of them works as the other string instructions, ie they can send or receive many
bytes at once. When programming the TI-85 though, they seem <I>very</I> useless since ports
aren't used often.</P>

</FONT>
</P>

<P>Now that you know what ports are, you may wonder how you can use them in your programs.
More important maybe, is why? To communicate with the linkport is one reason of course, but
quite often you also want to use port 1 to read whichs keys are held down. Why? Because
GET_KEY has one, big, disadvantage: it can't read multiple keys. If you hold down more than one
key, it acts as if no key has been pressed down (I think). In this section I will explain how you to
use port 1. It will require that you have understood lesson #4 because when working with ports,
it's at "bit level".</P>

<P>It's kind of hard to explain in detail exactly why you should do this and that, so try to live
with it :-). To check if some keys are held down, you should first send a mask to port 1 and
after that receive a byte from port 1 telling which keys are held down, according to the mask.</P>

<P>You should read the table like this: If you want to know if Cos is pressed down at
the moment, you should first send the mask $F7 through port 1, then receive a byte
and check if bit 5 is cleared. If it's cleared, then Cos is held down. Code:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
ld a,$F7
out (1),a
in a,(1)
bit 5,a
jr z,Cos_Is_Held_Down
</PRE></FONT>

<P>How does the mask work? What happens if I use other masks than the ones in the table?
If you convert any of the masks above into binary, you'll find that all bits except one are set.
For example, $F7 = %11110111. Bit 3 is cleared, which means that the returned value is an
indicator for the third row (with row 0 as the first row). If you send a mask with more than
one bit cleared, for example $F3 = %11110011, the returned byte would be an indicator for
both row 2 and 3. If we found that bit 5 on the returned byte is cleared, it means that either
Cos or Tan is pressed, there is no way of knowing which (both may be pressed also of course). 
That means it's often pretty dumb to send such a mask.</P>

<P>There are only seven rows in the table, meaning one of the bits isn't used (the most significant
bit). The last bit in the mask is therefore not important (doesn't mean anything) and there is no
difference if you use the mask $F7 or $77 ($77 = %01110111).</P>

<P>The reason the table looks the way it looks is how the keys are wired to each other. One
consequence of this is that if you hold down three keys so they form three corners in a rectangle it
will result in that the fourth key in the rectangle will act as if pressed down. For example, if you
press down EE, Ln and Stat and send the mask $DF, you'll find that the resulting byte will have
both bit 4 and 6 are cleared. There is no way around this (if you don't want to rewire the keys
somehow...) so don't choose key combinations that may cause this!</P>

<P>You may also have noticed that the ON key isn't in the table above. That's because the ON
key works a bit different - when you press down ON an interrupt occur (even if the interrupts
are disabled). There is a way to check if the ON key is pressed down though. If the third bit
of a received byte from port 3 is cleared, then ON is held down:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
in a,(3)
bit 3,a
jr z,ON_Is_Held_Down
</PRE></FONT>

<P>One important thing when using port is that ports only detects keys currently held down.
If you manage to press down and release a key between two port checks, that press will go
unnoticed, so be sure to check the keys quite often so you don't have to hold down the key
half a second before it's noticed. 200 times per second is maybe not necessar, but at least
10 times/second, else the game control will not be perfect.</P>

<P>I've made a program so you can check if the table above is correct. It shows the table
above, except that if a key is NOT held down, a black square is shown in it's place, else
it's empty. You can also experiment with pressing down three keys so they form the
cornors of a rectangle, and then you'll see that the fourth key is indicated as held down.

<P>When using multikeys, it's most often the arrows keys you're interested in. Diagonal
movement is often good. The other keys (such as Exit, 2nd) can often be checked with
either GET_KEY or reading from the RAM memory. If not, you have to make to seperate
checks. One alternative is sending the mask $BD through the port. The drawback with
this is that the keys F2-F5 can be used as arrowskeys :-)</P>

<P>Here's an example code:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#808080"><PRE>
MainLoop:
 ld a,$FE          ; Check the arrow keys
 out (1),a
 in a,(1)
 bit 0,a
 CALL_Z(MoveDown)  ; The routines called must preserve A!!
 bit 1,a
 CALL_Z(MoveLeft) 
 bit 2,a
 CALL_Z(MoveRight)
 bit 3,a
 CALL_Z(MoveUp)
 ld a,$BF          ; Check F1-F5, 2nd, Exit, More
 out (1),a
 in a,(1)
 bit 5,a
 CALL_Z(Fire)
 bit 6,a
 jr nz,MainLoop
 call GET_KEY      ; Clear the keybuffer
 ret
</PRE></FONT>

<P>When you check keys through the port, the key buffer is not cleared. The interrupt handler
will still store the last key pressed down, and GET_KEY will find the last key pressed even if
you did your keyscans through ports. If you exit the program with Exit, you'll end up in TI-OS
because when returning to ZShell, the Exit key will still be in the keybuffer. To avoid that,
clear the keybuffer by a simple call GET_KEY (since the size of the buffer is just one single 
byte).</P>

<P>That was the end of this lesson! Happy ZShell coding!</P>
