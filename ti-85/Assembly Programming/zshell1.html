Welcome to the first lesson of the ZShell School! This first lesson
may be a bit boring, but it's really necessary to know how the calculator
works and a bit about the RAM memory, so you know what you do when you
program. In the end of the lesson we'll make a classic "Hello World!"
program.</P>

I will now explain a very important part when you're programming a lowlevel
language. You who know this stuff may skip this section.</P>

<P>Our own number system has the base 10, and that's because we humans
have 10 fingers. Computers (and calculators) don't have fingers, they have
electricity. To make it easy, there are two conditions, on and off, or
0 and 1. That is a <I>bit</I>. Since it's a bit unpractical to work with
the base 2, we put together 8 bits and then we got a <I>byte</I> (ex 01101011).
A byte range between 0 and 255 (there are 2^8 = 256 different ways to combinate
8 bits). 16 bits are called a <I>word</I> (0-65535). Less common is a <I>nibble</I>
which range between 0 and 15 (4 bits) and octal (0-7 and 3 bits). </P>


<P>What is <I>hexadecimal</I>? In the hexadecimal representation, a group
of four bits (nibble) is encoded as one hexadecimal digit. Hexadecimal
digits are represented by the symbols from 0 to 9, and by the letters A
(10), B (11) ... F (15). A byte is represented by two hexdigits (ex D3).</P>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF8000">
<FONT SIZE=4>Convert between decimal - hexadecimal - binary</FONT>
</FONT><BR>

One way is to use the calculator of course, but it's often faster to do it
in your head. It's very easy to convert between hex and binary. Remember
that a hexadecimal number consist of two groups of four bits. Just take
one group at a time. </P>

<UL>
<PRE>| 0100 | 1100 | -> 4C</PRE>

<PRE>D5 -> | 1101 | 0101 |</PRE>
</UL>

<P>Binary to decimal is simple math. Just go from right to left and take
bit <I>n</I> * 2^<I>n</I>. The bits in a byte are numbered 0-7, right to
left. Each bit is worth 1, 2, 4, 8 and so on. </P>

<UL><PRE>
10010101 = 1*2^0 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^2 + ... + 1*2^7 =
         = 1 + 4 + 16 + 128 = 149
</PRE></UL>

<P>To convert from decimal to binary is also easy. One way is to divide
the decimal number with two, and keep the remainder and so on. </P>

<UL><PRE>
173/2 = 86, remainder 1,
 86/2 = 43, remainder 0,
 43/2 = 21, remainder 1,
 21/2 = 10, remainder 1,
 10/2 =  5, remainder 0,
  5/2 =  2, remainder 1,
  2/2 =  1, remainder 0,
  1/2 =  0, remainder 1.

Collect the remainders backwards and you get 10101101
</PRE></UL>

<P>When you want to go between hex and decimal (the most common convertation)
you can first convert to binary and then convert it to decimal/hexadecimal.
Choose your own way, because you will do it often. </P>

I won't write so much here because it's really simple. You only need
know a little about two compliment and you know the rest, because the compiler
will do it automatically when you compile your assemly program. You need
to know what happens to some length though. </P>

<P>What you need to know is this: -1 = 255, -2 = 254. You should understand
the rest then :-) If you want to add 5 with -3 for example, this is what
will happen:
<UL><PRE>
 5       = 00000101
-3 = 253 = 11111101
           --------
          100000010
</PRE></UL>
</P>

<P>Since a byte only can store 8 bits, the first 1 will disappear and 00000010
is left = 2 which is the correct result! (The bit doesn't really disappear,
it will be stored in the Carry Flag. More about that in the next lesson)

The TI-85 uses a 8-bit Z80 processor. Since it's a 8-bit processor,
instructions that only take one byte are generally faster executed than
longer instructions. A Z80 can &quot;reach&quot; 64k (1k = 1024 byte. 64k
= 65536 byte) byte in the memory, so there are some limitations. (even
worse than Bill Gates 640k...) </P>

<P>The first 32k contains the ROM (The ROM is actually 128k, but only 32k
is accessable at one time) and the second 32k contains the RAM. You don't
have 32k to play with though, because about 4,5k is reserved for different
things (cursor positions, graph mem, text mem, menu pointers and a lot
more). Another difficulty is that all variables are moving around in the
memory when you create new vars or just change the Ans variable, so when
you want to access something from your program, you have to know where
the program is at the moment... Luckily, ZShell takes care of that part
so we don't have to bother (almost). </P>

If you haven't tried before, this will be your first program. And of
course it must be a classic &quot;Hello World!&quot; program! The source
code will follow below, and then I'll explain what each row does. I think
it's easiest that way. In the next lesson, I'll explain a bit more about
what each instructions really do.
<FONT COLOR="#888888"><UL><PRE>

</P>

<P>The first line includes the <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">TI-85.H</FONT> file which
contains a lot of alias (I write those aliases with capital letters). Without
it the code will be much harder to understand. Most aliases is just an alias
for a memory address or a byte.</P>

<P>All programs begin with <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">.org 0</FONT>. It has to do with
that you program will move around in the memory while it's on the calc. To make it
simple, the compiler will assume that you program begins at offset 0 (but it really
doesn't) but when you want to access variables, you add the offset of the
program (which ZShell knows) and it will be correct.</P>

<P>The second line is just a description of the program. It will be displayed
in ZShell. It must end with ,0 so ZShell will know where the string ends
(strings ended with ,0 is called zero-terminated strings).</P>

<P>Then the program starts. The <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">ROM_CALL</FONT> is just an alias
which is included in the <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">TI-85.H</FONT> file, and what really
happens is that it jumps into a place in the ROM where the screen is cleared. In that
way, we don't need to write our own code to clear the LCD.</P>

<P>The next two rows moves the cursor to the top left cornor of the screen,
and the three rows after that loads the text string at the bottom program
into hl (or more exactly, hl points to the string). Here we have an example
that we need to know where in the memory the string is stored. ZShell stores
the location of our program in the memory (<FONT COLOR="#FF8000">PROGRAM_ADDR</FONT>
is just an alias of that memory location) so we just add those two offsets.</P>

<P>Then we display the string with another <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">ROM_CALL</FONT>
and at the end we wait for the user to press the Exit key.</P>

<P>This was just a quick description of how the program worked, and if
you didn't understand it all, don't worry.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#FF8000">
<FONT SIZE=5>C<FONT SIZE=4>OMPILING</FONT></FONT>
</FONT><BR>

Compiling is a procedure that transform your source code into an executable
file. In this case, it's a .85S file which can be executed on your TI-85
using ZShell.</P>

<P>You need a couple of programs. First, you need <A HREF="http://www.ticalc.org/pub/dos/asm/tasm301.zip">TASM
3.0.1</A> (not Turbo Assembler) and you also need <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">STRING85</FONT>
which you should have since it's included in the ZShell package. Then you
need a link program, but you probably already have one. If you don't, you
should go to <A HREF="http://www.ticalc.org" target="_top">www.ticalc.org</A> and get
one. There are different link programs depending on which kind of link and
computer you have. Of course you also need <A HREF="http://www.ticalc.org/pub/85/asm/shell/zshell.zip">ZShell
4.0</A>, else it will definately not work :-).</P>

<P>When you compile the program, you must have the file <FONT COLOR="#FF8000">TASM80.TAB</FONT>
(included in the tasm zip file) in the same directory. You compile the code with
this line:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#888888"><UL>
<PRE>tasm -80 -q -g3 -r12 -i myfile.asm</PRE>
</UL></FONT>

<P>where myfile.asm is your source (of course you should replace <I>myfile</I>
with the name of the program). If your code is big (>1000 lines),
it will take a while because tasm is slow. If you get errors it will show...
After you've done that you have to rename a file before using string85:</P>

<FONT COLOR="#888888"><UL>
<PRE>rename myfile.obj myfile
string85 myfile</PRE>
</UL></FONT>

<P>You should now have a file called <I>myfile.85s</I> which can be sent
to the TI-85 using a linkprogram. Typing all this every time you want
to compile your program takes some time though, so it's recommended
that you use a batch file for this. Check out the <A HREF="zshell.html#how">Compiling</A>
section at the <A HREF="zshell.html">ZShell School mainpage</A>.</P>

<P>There is one thing you should know when you use TASM: You <I>must</I>
make at least one space from the left margin if the row in the source contains
an instructions, and all label <I>may not</I> contain any spaces. Else
you get a lot of errors when compiling.</P>
