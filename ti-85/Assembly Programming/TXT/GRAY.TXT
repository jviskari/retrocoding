Heres' the code and 85s of an 8 level grayscale viewer. Its very 
simple at the moment. It displays the file 'GrayPic.85s', which has 
the format:
offset - data
00 - $00 (to stop it being RCL'd)
01 - $7F (ID- Grayscale Pic)
02 - 1024 bytes of screen data for Most Significant Bit
$402 - 1024 bytes of screen data for middle bit
$802 - 1024 bytes of screen data for Least Significant Bit.

Also attached should be a demo picture.
